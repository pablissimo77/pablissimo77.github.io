### Data discovery

So you've got that amazing set of data from an API, but all you see is a chunk of random JSON? ObjectPath shell can help you navigate this mess. Just do:

$ ObjectPath -u //URL-to-API/call
ObjectPath interactive shell
ctrl+c to exit.

Loading JSON document from //URL-to-API/call done.
